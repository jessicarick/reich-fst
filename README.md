# reich-fst
A short R script to calculate the Reich-Patterson FST estimator (Reich et al. 2009, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08365) and bootstraps from a genlight object. All pairwise FST estimates will be calculated between populations in the genlight object.

This script was first used in Junker et al. 2020, _Molecular Ecology_ ([https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15559](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15559)) and depends on the `dartR` package([https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dartR/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dartR/index.html)). If you use this script in a publication, please cite the Junker et al. 2020 paper!
